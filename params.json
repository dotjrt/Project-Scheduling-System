{"name":"Project Resource Allocation Optimization","tagline":"optimize resource allocations to tasks within a project","body":"## What\r\nMy project is a system that will optimize resource allocation to tasks within a task network. The system is given two inputs: A task network where some tasks may be dependent on the completion of others in order to be started and a resource pool where each resource's efficiency for each task is rated on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the best. \r\n\r\nThe system will then output a Gantt chart showing a schedule of when tasks should be started and completed, to include the possibility of \"float\" - that is, a possible delay in completing a task such that it will not hold up the rest of the project from on-time completion. The system will also output an optimized day-by-day assignment of resources to tasks. \r\n\r\n## Why\r\nThis software is intended to be a tool for project managers within a business organization to assist in the process of more efficient resource allocation within the confines of a complex project schedule.
