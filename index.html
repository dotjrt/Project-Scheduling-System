        <h2>
<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What</h2>

<p>My project is a system that will optimize resource allocation to tasks within a task network. The system is given two inputs: A task network where some tasks may be dependent on the completion of others in order to be started and a resource pool where each resource's efficiency for each task is rated on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the best. </p>

<p>The system will then output a Gantt chart showing a schedule of when tasks should be started and completed, to include the possibility of "float" - that is, a possible delay in completing a task such that it will not hold up the rest of the project from on-time completion. The system will also output an optimized day-by-day assignment of resources to tasks. </p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h2>

<p>This software is intended to be a tool for project managers within a business organization to assist in the process of more efficient resource allocation within the confines of a complex project schedule. </p>

<h2>
<a id="methods" class="anchor" href="#methods" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methods</h2>

<p>The system takes two inputs provided by a project manager. Input consists of a project with a dependent task network like the one pictured below. The project manager also provides a resource pool where each resource (i.e. employee/engineer) has been rated on a scale of 1-5 for their ability to complete each task.
